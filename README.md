Here you can find additional calculations for the paper "Determination of a dynamic top-down greenhouse gas budget for buildings in Germany".

The calculations are done with python and different libraries. Germany is used as a case study.

The calculations are structured as follows:
1) "01_static budget determination" calculates a static budget for the operational and embodied greenhouse gas emissions.
2) "02_functions for emissions" development calculates functions for the development of the share of non-renewable energies in the heating and electricity mix and the reduction in embodied emissions.
3) The first two folders are then combinded to calculate the dynamic greenhouse gas budget for operational and embodied emissions in the folder "03_dynamic budget determination".
